1. What is the role of the permanent magnet in a motor?
- When a wire is placed near a permanent magnet, the permanent magnet's field will interact with the temporary magnetic field. The two magnets placed near one another will either attract or repel.  The temporary magnetism around the wire will attract or repel the permanent magnetism from the magnet, causing the wire to jump.


2. What is the role of the brushes in a DC motor?
- Electric power is fed into a commutator through a pair of loose connectors called brushes, which "brush" against the commutator. When electricity flows through the circuit, the coil rotates continually in the same direction.


3. Imagine you have a robot and want that robot to scan the room for obstacles to decide how to move around. You have a proximity sensor that measures distance. What type of motor might you use to rotate the proximity sensor to scan the room -- a DC motor, a stepper motor, or a servo motor? Why?
- A DC motor, because they are fast, continuous rotation motors...
